# 🧟‍♂ Zombiz – HTML & CSS Website Project

Welcome to *Zombiz, a creative and responsive website built entirely using **HTML5* and *CSS3*.  
This project was developed as a part of my frontend learning journey to master the basics of UI layout, 
design structure, and responsive styling — without using any frameworks or JavaScript.
